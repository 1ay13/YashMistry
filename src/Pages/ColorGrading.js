        Color Grading - Round-Trip Workflow
      </h1>

      <p className="p-5 text-lg">
        While there are some exceptions, grading applications are generally
        designed to import an EDL, XML, or AAF file thatâ€™s been exported from an
        NLE after the edit has been completed and then to export a corresponding
        EDL, XML, or AAF file of the finished project to send back to the
        original NLE. This process is referred to as a round-trip.
      </p>
      <p className="px-5 text-lg">
        An outline of the average round-trip workflow is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-10 md:pl-24 text-lg p">
        <li>Lock the edit (you hope).</li>
        <li>Prep your timeline for handoff.</li>
        <li>Export the edit, Export the XML, AAF or EDL.</li>
        <li>Organize accompanying media.</li>
        <li>Grade the project.</li>
        <li>Render the final graded media.</li>
        <li>
          Export the graded timeline, and reimport it into your NLE or finishing
          application.
        </li>
      </ul>
